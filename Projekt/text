Project files for map contouring using the marching squares algorithm

The project is almost complete, although a bit unorganized still.

  The program takes a topological map (scalar field) as input. Then after we select what elevations we want to make contour lines,
it turns the data of the map into binary (higher or lower than given altitude). It then applies the marching squares algorithm on this
new "binarized" data. We can do that for a few elevations and then combine them into one "contour map" (no graphical visualization).
  Also, the program can take a point on the map (reasonably within a contour line that is FULLY inside the map (not cut off at the edges)),
and calculate the
